## 🌟 Executive Summary

**AYITRIX PM (AyiPM)** is an internal company management system engineered to replace fragile spreadsheets and disjointed chat-based workflows. Features a sleek, modern **Light Enterprise Design Theme** with electric blue & cyan brand accents, and centralizes six core operational modules into a unified, role-aware dashboard for **Administrators**, **Project Managers**, and **Employees**:

1. **Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Three personas with differentiated UI and workflow privileges.
2. **Employee Management** — Complete staff directory, department structures, designations, and soft deactivation.
3. **Attendance & Punctuality Engine** — Automatic check-in/out derivation, grace period (09:15 AM) detection, and working-hours accounting.
4. **Leave Management & Approval Workflows** — Annual balance allocations (Vacation, Sick, Casual) and two-way manager review.
5. **Projects Portfolio** — Five-stage deliverable lifecycle tracking, client attribution, budget metrics, and team rosters.
6. **Tasks & Kanban Delivery Board** — Interactive 4-column sprint board, priority indicators, deadlines, comments, and task histories.
7. **Unified Audit Log** — Real-time event ledger capturing every state modification across the entire enterprise.

## 🏛️ Technology Stack & Architecture Rationale

In alignment with **Week 1: Technology Selection** of the project roadmap, the stack was chosen based on team familiarity, ecosystem maturity, and zero-compromise deliverability:

| Layer                       | Technology                            | Decision Rationale                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend Framework**      | **Next.js 14+ (App Router)**          | Server and client component ergonomics, declarative routing, and production-ready hydration performance.                        |
| **Language**                | **TypeScript (Strict Mode)**          | End-to-end type safety across domain interfaces, reducing runtime edge-case bugs in calculation logic.                          |
| **Styling & Design System** | **Modular Vanilla CSS**               | Custom CSS design tokens, glassmorphism surfaces (`backdrop-filter`), slate/indigo corporate palette, zero CSS library lock-in. |
| **Iconography**             | **Lucide Icons**                      | Consistent visual language across workflows, navigation, and status badges.                                                     |
| **State & Persistence**     | **React Context + Web Storage**       | Zero-latency optimistic UI updates with automatic browser persistence and realistic mock seed datasets.                         |
| **Target Database Schema**  | **PostgreSQL (12 relational tables)** | Relational integrity with foreign keys, soft deletes (`deleted_at`), and immutable audit logging.                               |

## 👥 Team Structure & Ownership Map

The project was mapped for a 4-engineer team structure where every member owns dedicated functional slices:

| Engineer  | Role                   | Primary Responsibilities                                                            | Module Ownership                                  |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dev 1** | Tech Lead / Full-Stack | Architecture, relational schema, CI pipeline, code review, release management       | Auth & Roles, Database Schema, Staging Deployment |
| **Dev 2** | Backend Engineer       | API design, business logic (attendance derivation, leave balances), background jobs | Attendance API, Leave API, Reports Engine         |
| **Dev 3** | Frontend Engineer      | Navigation shell, design system tokens, forms & validation, tables & filters        | UI Foundation, Employee Directory, Dashboard UI   |
| **Dev 4** | Frontend + QA Lead     | Kanban interaction, calendar views, responsive behavior, bug triage & test passes   | Kanban Board, Leave Calendar, QA Test Plan        |

## 🔒 Role-Based Permissions Matrix

AyiPM enforces a three-tier permission model across both presentation and operational layers:

| Capability / Action                 |   Administrator   |  Project Manager   |         Employee         |

## 💡 Key Highlights & Interactive Features

- **Live Persona Switcher**: Use the dropdown in the top header to instantly switch between **Admin**, **Project Manager**, and **Employee** perspectives to see permissions, metrics, and navigation adjust in real time.
- **Attendance Station**: Click **Check In** in the top navbar or the Attendance page. The system calculates working hours and checks punctuality (grace window until 09:15 AM).
- **Leave Approval Sync**: When an Admin or PM approves a leave request, the employee's balance is automatically updated and an attendance record for that date is logged as **On Leave**.
- **Interactive Kanban Board**: Reorder tasks across `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done` columns, filter by project or priority, and inspect audit histories.
- **Reset State**: Click the reload icon in the top navigation bar anytime to reset the local browser state back to the official seed data.

## 🔮 Post-MVP Roadmap

As documented in **Section 07** of the roadmap specification:

- **v1.1**: Real-time notifications (email + in-app), timesheet exports, task & project file attachments.
- **v1.2**: Payroll & expense reimbursement engine building directly on verified attendance logs.
- **v1.3**: Performance evaluations, quarterly OKR tracking, and 360 review cycles.
- **v2.0**: Candidate recruitment pipelines, company asset inventory, and native mobile apps (iOS & Android).

## 📄 License & Contribution Standards

- **Branching Strategy**: Trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches (`feat/`, `fix/`).
- **Code Review**: Every pull request requires at least one peer approval before merging to `main`.
- **Definition of Done**: Code merged, permissions verified server-side, responsive on mobile & desktop, and audited in the activity log.
